## [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com) with [Scheme](https://small.r7rs.org/).

The solutions are tested on the [Gambit](https://gambitscheme.org/) and the [Gauche](https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/) r7rs Scheme Interpreters.

The input file for each puzzle must be downloaded and placed as `input.txt` into the respective folder.
Then, `main.scm` should be run from within the folder.

To run on Gambit:
`gsi -:search=../lib,r7rs main.scm`

To run on Gauche:
`gosh -A../lib -r7 main.scm`
